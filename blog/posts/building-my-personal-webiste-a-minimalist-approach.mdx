## Overview

Building a personal website is always a balancing act between aesthetics, functionality, and performance. The first version of my site was overly complex, with many pages and data poorly presented, often making it hard for users to focus on key information. For version two, I embraced **minimalism**, reducing the number of pages and prioritizing a clear, efficient display of data. This post explores the **tech stack**, **design philosophy**, and the **technical solutions** behind the latest iteration of my site. üåê‚ú®

<section id="introduction">  
## Introduction

The first version of my website felt like an extension of my CV, with multiple detailed pages. While functional, it lacked focus and overwhelmed users with unnecessary complexity. In the second version, I aimed for a **minimalist design**, focusing on essential information and enhancing user engagement. The core goal? Efficiency in navigation, data presentation, and interaction. üéØ

<section id="tech-stack">  
## Tech Stack

For this version, I opted for a modern stack tailored to my needs:

- **Next.js 15**: Testing the new **Turbopack** for a faster development experience and the App Router for structured navigation.
- **React 19**: Leveraging the latest features.
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring type safety across the codebase.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first approach for rapid styling.
- **shadcn/ui**: Pre-built accessible components for consistency.
- **MagicUI**: Eye-catching animations for a polished user experience.

Each tool was chosen to balance **developer productivity** with a seamless **user experience**. üöÄ

## Home and Presentation Sections

The **homepage** starts with a `Featured` component that directs attention to key projects or updates. Currently, it highlights [Euro Hackathons](https://github.com/lorenzopalaia/Euro-Hackathons), a curated list of upcoming onsite hackathons in Europe that I maintain.

Next is a **personal introduction** showcasing key details like my role and a direct link to my CV. Subtle graphical accents from MagicUI make this section visually engaging without being overwhelming.

The **minimalist approach** here emphasizes fewer sections with greater impact. üõ†Ô∏è

## Skills and Experience

In the **skills section**, I moved away from subjective progress bars. Seriously, what does _‚Äú90/100 in Next.js‚Äù_ even mean? Did I lose 10 points for not memorizing the docs? üòÖ Instead, I use a simple list of badges to showcase my skills without exaggeration. üéñÔ∏è

For the **experience section**, I implemented a **timeline view** to chronologically display my professional journey. A toggle allows users to switch between career, education, and personal achievements. The data is stored in a `config.ts` file, making updates effortless without modifying the components. This **config-driven paradigm** ensures scalability and maintainability. üóÇÔ∏è

## Projects and Blog

### Featured Projects

Featured projects are rendered using a reusable card component. Data is fetched from a combination of a GitHub API and a local configuration:

1. **GitHub API**: Retrieves repository details, including the list of languages used. To manage rate limits, I use **cache headers** for responses and handle language data through a separate endpoint.
2. **Custom Config**: Projects not hosted on GitHub are integrated using a standardized configuration file.

To handle missing elements like repository previews, I use a `repo_assets` directory where each project has a `preview.webp`. If no preview exists, a fallback image is displayed. This setup balances **real-time updates** with **rate-limit management**.

In the **featured projects** section, I use a config file to filter and display the most relevant projects. On the **projects page**, projects are sorted by their `updated_at` field to highlight recent changes.

### Blog

The blog is dynamically generated from `.mdx` files. Posts are displayed with a dynamic route based on their slug, and features like a **Table of Contents** and **LaTeX support** enhance readability.

The blog archive includes a search bar to filter posts by title, description, or tags, offering an interactive browsing experience. üìñ

<section id="contact-and-small-features">  
## Contact and Small Features

The **contact form** uses `zod` for validation and `Resend` for reliable email handling. ‚úâÔ∏è

Other notable features include:

- **Skeleton loaders** for smooth transitions during data fetching.
- **Dynamic sorting** for prioritizing recent projects and posts.
- A **theme switcher** that syncs with the user's system preferences.
- **Dot patterns** and **animated overlays** provide subtle design enhancements. The animated overlay is powered by a custom library, [Tailwind Animations](https://github.com/lorenzopalaia/Tailwind-Animations), that I developed.
- **Sitemap generation** with `next-sitemap` at build time.

These small details collectively elevate the user experience. üíé

## Conclusion

Revamping my website was a journey of refining both design and functionality. By embracing **minimalism**, I‚Äôve created a platform that is visually appealing, highly functional, and easy to maintain. From testing new features like Turbopack to leveraging a **config-driven approach**, this iteration reflects my dedication to efficiency and user-focused development.

The experience has reinforced my belief in balancing **simplicity** and **impact**‚Äîa philosophy I aim to carry into future projects. ‚ú®
