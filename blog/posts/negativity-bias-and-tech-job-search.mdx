Tech job market in 2025 is a paradox: opportunities abound, yet the narrative online is often bleak.

But how much of this negativity reflects reality, and how much is amplified by our own psychological wiring? In this post, I’ll break down how negativity bias and review platforms distort our perception, why IT consulting gets such a bad rap, and how to reclaim agency in your career search.

## Introduction

It’s tempting to believe the worst about the tech job market—especially if you’ve spent time on Reddit, Glassdoor, or other forums. Stories of unpaid overtime, toxic management, and endless turnover dominate the conversation. But are things really as bad as they seem? Or are we falling into a psychological trap that makes the negative impossible to ignore? My own journey through this landscape taught me a crucial lesson: negativity bias is real, and it’s holding us back.

## Negativity Bias in the Job Search

Negativity bias is a powerful cognitive phenomenon: we instinctively give more weight to bad news than good. In the context of job hunting, this means:

- **One bad review outweighs dozens of positive ones.**
- **We remember negative stories longer and more vividly.**
- **We seek out information that confirms our fears.**

For software engineers, this creates a feedback loop: the more we read, the more we expect disappointment. Even when reviews are accurate, they’re often exaggerated or lack context. The result? Decision paralysis and a sense that every company is a minefield.

## IT Consulting: The Echo Chamber

No sector gets slammed online quite like IT consulting. The usual accusations:

- **Low salaries**: Entry-level roles often start around €21,000 net, with seniors rarely exceeding €32,000.
- **High turnover**: Stories of revolving doors and burned-out teams are everywhere.
- **Unpaid overtime**: Many complain about “grey” hours and subtle pressure to work late.
- **Stagnant careers**: Employees report feeling stuck in junior roles for years.

But here’s the catch: these reviews often come from the most disgruntled ex-employees. Happy or even moderately satisfied staff rarely post. The result is an echo chamber where every negative experience is amplified, and nuance is lost.

## Review Platforms: How Trustworthy?

Platforms like Glassdoor and Reddit are invaluable, but their reliability is questionable:

- **Selection bias**: Departing staff are far more likely to leave reviews—often out of frustration or revenge.
- **Manipulation**: Companies can pay to have “fake” negative reviews removed or to boost positive ones.
- **Non-disparagement clauses**: Some firms prevent honest reviews through legal agreements.
- **Lack of specifics**: Many reviews are vague, lacking details about teams, projects, or timeframes.

The bottom line: online reviews are a data point, not gospel. Treat them as one perspective among many.

## Psychological Toll and Paralysis

The constant barrage of negativity takes a toll:

- **Anxiety**: 72% of job seekers say the process harms their mental health.
- **Impostor syndrome**: Reading endless complaints makes even qualified engineers doubt themselves.
- **Paralysis**: Fear of making the “wrong” choice leads to inaction.

But here’s what’s often missed: many engineers do find fulfilling roles—even in consulting. Experiences vary dramatically by team, project, and personal goals.

## Hope and Strategies for a Balanced Search

Despite the noise, there’s hope—and practical ways to cut through the negativity:

- **Diversify your sources**: Talk to current employees, attend meetups, and network beyond anonymous forums.
- **Be the narrator, not the actor**: Read reviews objectively. Ask: What’s the context? Does this apply to me?
- **Look for specifics**: Prioritize reviews with concrete examples, not vague complaints.
- **Use reviews to inform your questions**: Ask targeted questions in interviews about work-life balance, career growth, and team culture.
- **Remember the upside**: Even challenging environments offer learning, resilience, and network-building.

The tech scene isn’t perfect, but it’s not the wasteland some would have you believe.
