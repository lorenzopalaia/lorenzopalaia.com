## Introduction

Alright, I know what you're thinking... It sounds like "oh look, another fool talking about the importance of contributing to open source projects". 🙄 And yeah, you're right. But you know what? I'm currently enjoying the magic of the first contribution, so what's the best way to enjoy this experience even more? Yes, you got it! **Share it with others**. 🌐 I don't want to annoy you, so let's dive in! 🚀

## Why did I just make my first contribution?

I'm not entirely sure, but let's try to provide an answer. Like many things I do, I had planned to start contributing to open source projects because I am interested in participating in **GSoC 2024** (I'll keep you updated...), but I haven't decided on a specific starting date yet. 📅 This is a common pattern in my life - I tend to plan many projects without a set start date. Instead, I end up starting them at random times when I receive unexpected inputs related to the projects I planned and when the conditions of time, confidence, and effort align. 🤔 And the occasion came with **Maybe**, a project related to personal finance found on GitHub. 🌐

I also enjoy witnessing the impact of projects in which I contribute. It is incredibly fulfilling to know that my efforts are making a difference and contributing to the improvement of something meaningful. 🌟 This is particularly significant when a project has previously been discontinued and is then revived with a large community of users and developers. 🔧 Observing how my work can positively influence others and contribute to the overall success of a project is truly satisfying. 😊

## Why Maybe?

As you probably (don't) know, I'm really into **personal finance**. 💰 I'm currently tracking my account statements using spreadsheets. 📊 Let me say that I've struggled a lot to create a visually appealing spreadsheet with plots and other features. Maybe one day I'll share it with you as a template. The point is that this spreadsheet worked fine for a year until I came across **Maybe** as a recommended repository while scrolling on GitHub (yeah, it came out of nowhere like a wild Pokémon). 🌐

Now, let me make a little confession. I probably have some kind of bias that leads me to interact with every platform or application that has a really nice-looking **UI**. Maybe honestly had that kind of look. It triggered my brain to dive deeper into the repo while I was scrolling instead of skipping. 🚀 I was really surprised about the modern UI which is, in general, my favorite type of style. 😍 I think it's a kind of deviation from the "scrolling on socials" bias, where our brain selects in a few seconds which content we will skip and what will keep our eyes fixed on the screen. We can also talk about biases in the future, as it's a topic that really interests me, even if I'm not really into psychology. 🤔

However, the main point is that **Maybe** has everything I need to keep my account statements updated. It offers the ability to connect with multiple banks to retrieve data, track various types of assets (such as stocks, cryptocurrencies, and real estate), and is **retirement-oriented**, providing features that estimate various parameters for retirement planning. This last point was a game-changer for me, as I had never come across these features anywhere else. 🎮
